# mod-16-counter
A Mod 16 Up Counter is a circuit used in counting that can go from 0, to 15 (16 states) before resetting. It uses four flip flops to represent the count in binary allowing it to increment by 1. Once it reaches a count of 15 it resets back, to 0 creating a repeating counting pattern. This type of counter is often utilized in applications that require counting or sequencing like microcontrollers, timers and digital clocks.
